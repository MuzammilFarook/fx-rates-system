# ✅ Restructured to Independent Microservices

## What Changed

You correctly identified that the architecture should be **independent microservices**, not a multi-module Maven project. I've restructured the entire project.

---

## 🔄 Before vs After

### Before: Multi-Module Maven Project ❌
```
fx-rates-system/
├── pom.xml  ← Shared parent (Spring Boot parent)
├── common-lib/ (child module)
├── fx-rates-api/ (child module)
├── rate-ingestion-service/ (child module)
└── websocket-service/ (child module)

Build: mvn clean install (all together)
Deploy: All together
Scale: All together
```

### After: Independent Microservices ✅
```
fx-rates-system/
├── pom.xml.multimodule.backup  ← Backed up
├── common-lib/
│   └── pom.xml ← Own Spring Boot parent
├── fx-rates-api/
│   └── pom.xml ← Own Spring Boot parent
├── rate-ingestion-service/
│   └── pom.xml ← Own Spring Boot parent
└── websocket-service/
    └── pom.xml ← Own Spring Boot parent

Build: Build each independently
Deploy: Deploy each independently
Scale: Scale each independently
```

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Multi-Module Parent**
- Backed up `pom.xml` to `pom.xml.multimodule.backup`
- No more shared parent POM

### 2. **Updated All Service POMs**
Each service now has:
- ✅ Its own `spring-boot-starter-parent`
- ✅ Independent `groupId` and `version`
- ✅ Dependency on `fx-rates-common-lib` (as external library)

**Example (fx-rates-api/pom.xml):**
```xml
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.0</version>
    <relativePath/>
</parent>

<groupId>com.fexco</groupId>
<artifactId>fx-rates-api</artifactId>
<version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fexco</groupId>
    <artifactId>fx-rates-common-lib</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

### 3. **Updated Dockerfiles**
Each Dockerfile now:
- ✅ Builds `common-lib` first (installs to local Maven repo)
- ✅ Builds the specific service independently
- ✅ No reference to parent POM

### 4. **Created Build Script**
- `build-all.sh` - Builds all services (convenience)
- But each service can be built separately

### 5. **Created Documentation**
- `MICROSERVICES-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Explains the architecture
- `RESTRUCTURE-SUMMARY.md` - This file

## 🚀 How to Build & Run

### Build All Services

```bash
./build-all.sh
```

This will:
1. Build `common-lib` → install to `~/.m2/repository/`
2. Build `fx-rates-api` → creates standalone JAR
3. Build `rate-ingestion-service` → creates standalone JAR
4. Build `websocket-service` → creates standalone JAR

### Build Individual Services

```bash
# Build common-lib first (required)
cd common-lib
mvn clean install

# Build any service independently
cd ../fx-rates-api
mvn clean package

# Or
cd ../rate-ingestion-service
mvn clean package
```

### Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Run Locally

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd fx-rates-api && mvn spring-boot:run

# Terminal 2
cd rate-ingestion-service && mvn spring-boot:run

# Terminal 3
cd websocket-service && mvn spring-boot:run
```

## 🎯 Why This Matters for Interview

### ✅ Correct Architecture

**Before (Wrong):**
> "I have a multi-module project where all services are built together"

**After (Correct):**
> "I have independent microservices. Each service has its own lifecycle, versioning, and can be deployed and scaled independently"

### Key Interview Talking Points

1. **"True microservices architecture"**
   - Each service is independently deployable
   - Services can be versioned separately (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0)
   - Can scale services independently based on load

2. **"Shared library for common models"**
   - Pragmatic approach to avoid code duplication
   - Still maintains service independence
   - In production, would be published to Maven repository

3. **"Event-driven communication"**
   - Services communicate via Event Hubs (async)
   - Loose coupling
   - No direct service-to-service calls

4. **"Kubernetes deployment reflects independence"**
   - Each service has own deployment, service, HPA
   - Can deploy/rollback individually
   - Can scale based on service-specific metrics

## 📊 Architecture Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Independent Deployment** | Deploy API service without touching WebSocket service |
| **Independent Scaling** | Scale API to 20 pods, WebSocket to 5 pods |
| **Independent Versioning** | API v2.0, WebSocket v1.5, Ingestion v1.2 |
| **Team Autonomy** | Different teams can own different services |
| **Technology Flexibility** | Could migrate one service to Kotlin/Go without affecting others |
| **Failure Isolation** | If WebSocket crashes, API still works |

## 🔍 What About common-lib?

### Why Shared Library?

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Avoid duplicating `FxRate`, `FxRateRequest`, etc. in 3 places
- ✅ Ensures data consistency across services
- ✅ Easier to evolve domain models

**Trade-offs:**
- ❌ Shared dependency (but lightweight)
- ❌ Need to coordinate updates (but rare)

### Alternative: Duplication

Some teams prefer **duplicating** models in each service for zero shared dependencies. For this project, shared library is pragmatic given:
- Common domain (`FxRate`)
- Small library (models only, no business logic)
- Easier to maintain

In production, `common-lib` would be:
- Published to Maven Central or Artifactory
- Versioned independently
- Services specify which version to use

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Run these commands to verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Build all services
./build-all.sh

# 2. Verify JARs created
ls -lh common-lib/target/*.jar
ls -lh fx-rates-api/target/*.jar
ls -lh rate-ingestion-service/target/*.jar
ls -lh websocket-service/target/*.jar

# 3. Test Docker builds
docker-compose build

# 4. Run services
docker-compose up
```

## 🎉 Result

You now have a **production-ready, true microservices architecture** that matches your design document. Each service is:

- ✅ Independently buildable
- ✅ Independently deployable
- ✅ Independently scalable
- ✅ Loosely coupled
- ✅ Interview-ready

This is the **correct implementation** for a microservices-based FX rates system!
