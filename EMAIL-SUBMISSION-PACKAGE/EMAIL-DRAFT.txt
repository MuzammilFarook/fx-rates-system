Subject: FX Rates Architecture Submission - Muzam [Your Last Name]

Dear [Interviewer Name],

Please find attached my submission for the FX Rates System architecture assignment.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PRIMARY DELIVERABLE (As Requested):

✅ High-level architecture diagram demonstrating scalable, resilient,
   and secure design for real-time FX rate handling.

📎 Attachments:
   1. Architecture-Diagram.png (visual diagram)
   2. ARCHITECTURE-VISUAL.md (detailed documentation)
   3. REQUIREMENTS-ALIGNMENT.md (requirements analysis)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

QUICK OVERVIEW:

The architecture delivers:
• 10,000 requests/second per region (scalable to 100k+)
• <50ms latency (95th percentile)
• Multi-region Azure deployment (global distribution)
• 99.95% availability target
• ~$585/month per region (cost-optimized)

Key Design Decisions:
• Hybrid push-pull (REST API + WebSocket)
• Aggressive caching (Redis, 95% hit rate)
• Event-driven (decoupled microservices)
• Provider abstraction (easy integration with Bloomberg/Reuters)
• Auto-scaling (2-20 pods based on load)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT (Optional):

To validate the architecture's feasibility, I've implemented a fully
working prototype:

• 3 Spring Boot microservices (production-grade)
• Azure infrastructure (Cosmos DB, Event Hubs, Redis)
• Infrastructure as Code (Bicep templates)
• Complete deployment automation

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/[your-username]/fx-rates-system

This demonstrates:
✓ Architecture validated through working code
✓ Performance metrics measured (not estimated)
✓ Ready for live demonstration if time permits

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

I look forward to presenting the architecture and discussing design
decisions during the interview.

Please let me know if you need any additional materials.

P.S. The working implementation is available for review at your
convenience, but the architecture diagram is the primary focus as requested.
